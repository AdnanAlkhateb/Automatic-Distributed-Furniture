# Automatic-Distributed-Furniture
we try to work on a specefic things that can make the life esay and more comfortable for people .<br>
we work on two main things : <br>
first one the user can divided the spesefiece area of his house 
for example by giving the mahine size of the ground and the number of the rooms
 he need to create it .. and the machine it will divided for him in most useful way and
the mean algorithm for this we use simulated annealing.
and the second thing you can choice any room from this areas and choice the furniture 
for this room and it will distrubushine with the rules the articture design depended
on the mean algorithm we used for it genetic algorithm
